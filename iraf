# this script wraps the running of iraf within its container and sets up the X windows configuration so
# the graphics windows work properly. it maps the current working directory into the container as /home/iraf/data
# and runs 'xgterm -e cl' there. if you want to switch to a different directory on the host, you'll need to exit
# and then rerun this script there.
